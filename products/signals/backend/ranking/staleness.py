"""When a served ranking score no longer describes the report's text.

A score is stale when the report's title or summary was edited after the vector the score read.
Only the two edit paths (the report PATCH and the scout `edit_report` tool) write the edit
artefacts, so the pipeline's own rewrites never mark a score stale.

The time a score is compared against is the landing time of the vector it read, not `scored_at`.
`scored_at` is the start of the sweep pass, and a team's vectors are read later in the pass. An
edit that is indexed in that gap gives a score on the new text with a `scored_at` before the edit.
The vector lands after the commit of the edit that produced it, so a vector newer than the edit
holds the edited text. A score with no vector time falls back to `scored_at`.

The serializer and the report-row ranking cache both use this rule.
